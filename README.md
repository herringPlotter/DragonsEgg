# DragonsEgg
A mad-libs-esque 'game'. The words don't wrap. Not sure how to fix that yet. Written in CodeBlocks.

As with normal mad libs, you are told whether the word is a noun, adjective, etc, and then you fill in the blanks. 
The difference, with this version, is that it can be played by one person without ruining the storyline. The computer reads the type of word instead of a friend.

Probably best enjoyed by lonely people.
